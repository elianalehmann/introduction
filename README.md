Introduction 
About

I’m a junior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I’m studying Informatics with a concentration in Data Science and double majoring with a Bachelor’s degree with an individualized concentration (BDIC). Within this program at UMass I created and proposed my own design curriculum, and declared a concentration in Social Design - focusing on design application and its relationship to community. Additionally, I am on the executive board as an event planner for the Students for Sustainable Fashion & Art Club. 

I am currently employed as a Sales Associate at Brandy Melville in Boston. I maintain store aesthetics, craft store visuals, operate retail transactions, and provide service to customers. 

I am also interning and working under designer Eliana Rajao. I have helped manage her online shop. I handled customer databases, enhanced store appearances, and assisted in product merchandising and propping. 

My hobbies include painting and drawing, running cross country, baking, and singing.

My multicultural background has presented me to many opportunities. Apart from being a German citizen and speaking since birth, I studied at the German Saturday School of Boston for seven years and I currently hold a B2 level certificate in German. I am fluent in Spanish, and am literate in Brazilian Portuguese.
